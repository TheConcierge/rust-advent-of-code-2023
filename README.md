# Advent of Code 2023

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a yearly coding event, providing coding puzzles every day of December leading up until Christmas. 
Each daily puzzle comes in two parts, awarding a star with each complete part.

## Why am I doing AoC this year?
I have heard many good things about Rust and I wanted to try it out. Plus, this will give me something to do during
the downtime while at my folks for the holidays.

## Is this a good resource to learn idiomatic, best-practice Rust?
Absolutely not! I am a Rust beginner that is balancing "learning the correct way of doing things" while also trying to get the 
puzzles done each day. As this goes along, I hope to pick up more about the language and write Rust in a way that wouldn't
scare a professional. But it might also just be hot garbage the whole way through. You have been warned.

## Solution Explanations
Even though I won't claim that the Rust is any good, some of the solution approaches might be ok. I have included a write-up
of (most of) the problems in each day's folders. If you're stuck, this might provide some language-agnostic help.
